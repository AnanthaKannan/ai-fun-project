# Face Blur

## Concept
The concept of th project is, first we are finding the face and get the BBOX using **CascadeClassifier.** 
from the BBOX we are getting the face. 

Now we are going to blur the face which was getting by above. then we need replace the blurred face in to original image.

### Here I have mentioned the output of the project.
